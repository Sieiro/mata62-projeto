# Alchemist - Game Design Document

## Project Requirements and Overview

### HIGH CONCEPT
This is a management game, you must discover new recipes and items to craft in your lab, use mercenaries for the hard work (sometimes illegal) and make your own way to sate your ambition.

### STORY CONCEPT

FOR THOSE WHO LOST AND CANNOT FIND
 AN ILUSION,

MAY BE EVERYTHING!"
